    "* The transfer of information from one point to another without the use of wires or cables.\n",
    "* Uses radio waves (electromagnetic waves) to transmit data\n",
    "* Carrier frequency - the frequency $f_c$ of the wave that carries the information (e.g. 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 60 GHz)\n",
    "* Information is encoded into a wave by modulation\n",
    "    * Amplitude Modulation (AM) - changing the amplitude $A$ of the wave\n",
    "    * Frequency Modulation (FM) - changing the frequency of the wave slightly around $f_c$\n",
    "    * Phase Modulation (PM) - shifting the phase of the wave (timing of peaks and troughs)\n",
    "    * ...\n",
    "* The wave is then transmitted through the air.\n",
    "* The receiver decodes the wave back into information (via demodulation)\n",
