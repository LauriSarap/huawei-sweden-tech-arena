1) ~~How is SVD performed mathematically?~~
2) What are the limitations of classical SVD in noisy/incomplete data?

**SVD Optimizations**
* Outlier rejection
* Missing data imputation
* L1-norm SVD, Iterative re-weighting
* Robust PCA

1) What specific robust SVD algorithms exist?
2) How do they handle noise/outliers compared to classical SVD?

## Wireless Communication (5G/6G)

**Key Concepts**
* MIMO, Beamforming, Massive IoT
* Channel State Information (CSI)
* Precoding, Channel diagonalization

## Hardware-Aware AI & Optimization

* CPU/GPU/FPGA considerations
* Inference time, Energy consumption
* Model size, Memory footprint

1) How to design SVD solutions for real-time operation on edge devices?
2) What are the trade-offs between precision, speed, and energy?

## Benchmarking
